        <h2>Welcome to the Federal Relief Grant Program</h2>
        <p>The Federal Relief Grant provides financial assistance to individuals and businesses impacted by unforeseen events. Our goal is to support you during challenging times and help you recover swiftly.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Available Programs</h2>
        <h3>1. Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)</h3>
        <p>LIHEAP is a federal program designed to help low-income households manage the costs of home energy bills, energy crises, weatherization, and energy-related minor home repairs. Administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), LIHEAP provides assistance to eligible households through grants that are distributed to state, tribal, and territorial agencies. These agencies then allocate funds to residents who need help with their energy bills.</p>
        <p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Households must meet income eligibility criteria, which are based on the federal poverty level. Priority is often given to those with the highest energy costs or needs in relation to income.</p>
        <p><strong>Application Process:</strong> Interested individuals can apply through their local or state LIHEAP office. Documentation of income, household size, and energy costs is typically required.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)</h3>
        <p>TANF is a federal assistance program that provides financial aid to low-income families with children. The program aims to help these families achieve self-sufficiency through short-term financial assistance and supportive services.</p>
        <p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Eligibility varies by state, but generally, applicants must have dependent children and meet specific income and asset guidelines.</p>
        <p><strong>Application Process:</strong> Applications can be submitted through local TANF offices, with required documentation including proof of income, residency, and family composition.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)</h3>
        <p>SNAP, commonly known as food stamps, provides financial assistance to low-income individuals and families to purchase food. This program helps millions of Americans reduce food insecurity and allocate more of their income towards other essential bills.</p>
        <p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Eligibility is based on income, household size, and other factors. Applicants must fall within certain income limits relative to the federal poverty guidelines.</p>
        <p><strong>Application Process:</strong> Applications are managed at the state level and can often be completed online, by mail, or in person at local SNAP offices.</p>
        
        <h3>Federal Government Grants of $850 for Citizens weekly</h3>
        <p>In addition to programs that help with bills, there are specific grant programs that provide direct financial assistance to individuals. One such example is the Emergency Financial Assistance Program, which may offer grants of up to $850 to help cover essential expenses.</p>
        
        <h3>Emergency Financial Assistance Program</h3>
        <p>This program is designed to provide immediate financial relief to individuals and families facing unexpected financial crises. Grants can be used to cover a variety of expenses, including rent, utilities, medical bills, and other essential needs.</p>
